# LinkedIn Job Application Technical Constraints Log
**Session Date**: 2025-09-12
**Automation Target**: LinkedIn Job Applications for Alexander Fedin

## Technical Constraints Encountered

### 1. Browser Response Token Limits
- **Issue**: LinkedIn pages consistently exceed 25K token limit for browser automation responses
- **Impact**: Cannot use `browser_navigate` or `browser_snapshot` on job search results pages
- **Root Cause**: LinkedIn's complex DOM structure with extensive JavaScript-rendered content
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Direct navigation to specific job URLs
  - Filtered search parameters
  - Screenshot-based analysis

### 2. Dynamic DOM References
- **Issue**: Element references (`ref=eXXX`) change between browser operations
- **Impact**: Cannot reliably click on specific job listings or application buttons
- **Root Cause**: LinkedIn's dynamic content loading and React-based UI updates
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Fresh snapshots before interactions
  - Text-based element targeting
  - JavaScript evaluation for element selection

### 3. LinkedIn Anti-Automation Measures
- **Issue**: LinkedIn may detect automated browsing patterns
- **Impact**: Potential rate limiting or session restrictions
- **Mitigation**: Human-like interaction patterns, reasonable delays between actions
